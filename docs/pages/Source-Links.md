## The How

Each **Link Title** is followed by a short statement of critique, followed by a **Live Link**.

In turn, each **Live Link** is followed by **The Code** ( Markdown - Liquid ) required to render the hyperlink.

## Optional Stuff

A short statement of critique, a target, and a title can be added to the sample link, as well.
