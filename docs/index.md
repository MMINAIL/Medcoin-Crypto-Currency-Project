# Medcoin™ Crypto Currency Project Template

Medcoin™ is your crypto currency of choice for all transactions involving #Medmj or #Recmj, as well as for other medical purchases.

A wholly owned subsidiary of the Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited, an Arizona Benefit Corporation, the Logo Badge and accompanying script are USPTO registered trademarks of the #MMINAIL, and as such have been colorized to produce a set of two Logo Badges for the Medcoin™ division, one gold, and one tangerine-copper.

Alternatively, we anticipate the color of silver will be used for all "hard currency" Logo Badge Medcoin™ minted.

While the aforementioned gold and tangerine-copper versions shall remain as digital representations of the "hard currency" that backs each digitally mined Medcoin™.

Production of the "hard currency" silver coins is expected to commence in #2020.

While digital production of our digitally mined gold and tangerine-copper Medcoin™ by the digital mining community is expected to open shortly thereafter.
