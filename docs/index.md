**Note**. The above **Live** rendition of the **Medcoin™ Tangerine Copper Logo Badge** is an `( .svg )` image file set to the dimensions of 120.00 px X 120.00 px.

## Ownership

The Medcoin™ Crypto Currency Project is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited, an Arizona Benefit Corporation.

The Logo Badge and accompanying script are USPTO registered trademarks of the **MMINAIL[1]**, and as such have been colorized to produce a set of two fraternal twin Logo Badges for the Medcoin™ division, one gold, and one tangerine-copper.

Alternatively, we anticipate the color of silver will be used for all "hard currency" Medcoin™ minted, as well.

## Soft and Hard

The aforementioned gold and tangerine-copper versions shall remain as digital representations of the "soft currency" that backs each digitally mined Medcoin™.

Production of our proprietary secure, "hard currency" silver coin wallets is expected to commence on or shortly thereafter our successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

## Medcoin™ Miners

Digital production of the set of two crypto coins namely the gold Medcoin™ and the tangerine-copper Medcoin™ will commence at the time of the ICO when the crypto coin enters global circulation upon the release of our proprietary platform.

Shortly thereafter, our proprietary embedded "hard currency" silver coins will go into production via instant 3-D printing technology.

**Note**. The above synopsis carries several forward looking statements, and as such should not be construed as an incentive to invest in the company's Class B or Class C shares, when as and if issued.
